# Assignment 2: Plotting Weather Patterns

        # The Objective of this assignment is to create a line graph of the record highs and lows of temperature in Ann Arbour, Michigan in the time period 2005-2014.
        # For that we are given a dataset and the area between both line graphs will be shadowed. 
        # Also, we will graph a Scatterplot with the days in which the temperature in 2015 has broken over record highs or lows from 2005-2014.
